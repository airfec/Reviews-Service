# Review Microservice

> This is a stand-alone full-stack reviews microservice modeled after Airbnb's listing review component and is complete with pagination, search functionality, and a dynamic rating system. This was created using microservice oriented architecture and is meant to be integrated with my team's microservices to form a complete mock-up of an airbnb single item page.
